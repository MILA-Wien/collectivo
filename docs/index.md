# Welcome to the Documentation of Collectivo

Collectivo is a participatory membership platform and database for community projects. Through modular extensions, it can be customized and extended for the needs of different organizations.

The platform can be used for the management of memberships,
emails, payments, and shifts. Further functionalities can be added through the integration of external services as well as the development of custom extensions.

This project is in an early stage of development. It is a collaboration of
the Austrian cooperative [MILA Mitmach-Supermarkt](https://mila.wien/) and the IT collective
[convive\*](http://convive.io/) - funded by the
[AK Wien Digifonds](https://wien.arbeiterkammer.at/digifonds).
