Collectivo is an open-source membership platform for communities and collectives. Through modular extensions, it can be customized and extended for the needs of different organizations.

The features of Collectivo include management of memberships,
emails, payments, and shifts. Further functionalities can be added through the integration of [external services](extensions/components.md) as well as the development of [custom extensions](development.md#develop-custom-extensions).

This project is in an early stage of development. It is a collaboration of
the Austrian cooperative [MILA Mitmach-Supermarkt](https://mila.wien/) and the IT collective
[convive\*](http://convive.io/) - funded by the
[AK Wien Digifonds](https://wien.arbeiterkammer.at/digifonds).

If you are interested to use this software or contribute to development, please write to [info@collectivo.io](mailto:info@collectivo.io).
