# Welcome to the Documentation of Collectivo

Collectivo is an open-source membership platform for communities and
collectives. It is designed with a modular structure that makes it easy to
customize and extend the platform for the needs of different organisations and
integrate multiple tools into a single application.

The functionality of the platform can be composed through extensions. At the
moment, there are built-in extensions for the management of memberships,
emails, payments, and shifts. Custom extensions can further be added as both
internal apps or external microservices.

This project is in an early stage of development. It is a collaboration of the
the Austrian cooperative [MILA](https://mila.wien/) and the IT collective
[convive\*](http://convive.io/) - funded by the
[AK Wien Digifonds](https://wien.arbeiterkammer.at/digifonds).

If you are interested to use the software or contribute to development, please
