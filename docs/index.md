# Welcome to the Documentation of Collectivo

Collectivo is an open-source framework for participative community platforms.
It provides a modular structure that makes it is easy to customize for
the needs of different organisations.

Different applications can be added to the platform through extensions.
Built-in extensions exist to manage
applications, memberships, payments, emails, shifts, and more.
It is further possible to add custom extensions that can be written in
any programming language.

This project is in an early stage of development. It is a collaboration of the
the Austrian cooperative [MILA](https://mila.wien/) and the IT collective
[convive\*](http://convive.io/) - funded by the
[AK Wien Digifonds](https://wien.arbeiterkammer.at/digifonds).

If you are interested to use the software or contribute to development,
please write to [joel.foramitti@mila.wien](mailto:joel.foramitti@mila.wien).
