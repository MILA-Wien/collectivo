# Welcome to the Documentation of Collectivo

Collectivo is an open-source platform for community projects.
It is designed with a modular structure that makes it easy to
customize and extend the platform for the needs of different organisations.
It can thus be used to integrate multiple tools into a single platform and provides a framework to develop new applications.

The range of functions can be composed through the use of extensions. At the moment, there are built-in extensions for the management of memberships,
emails, payments, and shifts. Custom extensions can further be added as both
internal apps or external microservices.

This project is in an early stage of development. It is a collaboration of
the Austrian cooperative [MILA](https://mila.wien/) and the IT collective
[convive\*](http://convive.io/) - funded by the
[AK Wien Digifonds](https://wien.arbeiterkammer.at/digifonds).

If you are interested to use the software or contribute to development, please
